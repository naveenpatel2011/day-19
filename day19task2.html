            <h2>HTML</h2>
            HTML is a text file containing specific syntax, file and naming conventions that show the computer and the web server that it is in HTML and should be read as such. By applying these HTML conventions to a text file in virtually any text editor, a user can write and design a basic webpage, and then upload it to the internet.
The most basic of HTML conventions is the inclusion of a document type declaration at the beginning of the text file. This always comes first in the document, because it is the piece that affirmatively informs a computer that this is an HTML file. The document header typically looks like this: <!DOCTYPE html>. It should always be written that way, without any content inside it or breaking it up. Any content that comes before this declaration will not be recognized as HTML by a computer.
Doctypes are not just used for HTML, they can apply to the creation of any document that uses SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). SGML is a standard for specifying a specific markup language being used. HTML is one of several markup languages that SGML and doctype declarations apply to.
The other critical requirement for creating an HTML file is saving it with a .html file extension. Whereas the doctype declaration signals HTML to the computer from the inside of the file, the file extension signals HTML to the computer from the outside of the file. By having both, a computer can tell that it's an HTML file whether it's reading the file or not. This becomes especially important when uploading the files to the web, because the web server needs to know what to do with the files before it can send them to a client computer for the inner contents to be read.
After writing the doctype and saving as an HTML file, a user can implement all the other syntactic tools of HTML to customize a web page. Once finished, they will likely have several HTML files corresponding to various pages of the website.  It's important that the user uploads these files in the same hierarchy that they saved them in, as each page references the specific file paths of the other pages, enabling links between them. Uploading them in a different order will cause links to break and pages to be lost, because the specified file paths will not match the pages.

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a coding language that allows developers to specify how a web page should look. CSS describes how to use colors, fonts, and spacing, and how elements should be positioned on the page. It's a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It’s a stylesheet language used to add layout and visual effects to HTML elements.
            CSS is used specifically for markup languages, in this case HTML. A markup language is used to apply structure to a website or text document. The “markup” in this case is a set of tags used to indicate the structure and format of the page.
            The “cascading” part of its name refers to how styles are inherited and applied to different elements on a web page based on their relationship to each other in the HTML document. Styles can be applied to a parent element, which will be passed down to its child elements.

            <h2>JS</h2>
            JavaScript (JS) is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. It is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production (along with HTML and CSS).
JavaScript is an interpreted programming language, which means that it does not need to be compiled into machine code before it can be executed. This makes it very fast and easy to develop JavaScript applications.
JavaScript is also a very versatile language. It can be used to create a wide variety of web applications, from simple forms to complex games.
Here are some of the things you can do with JavaScript:
Add interactivity to web pages
Create animations and graphics
Validate user input
Send and receive data from a server
Control multimedia playback
Create games and other interactive applications
JavaScript is a very popular programming language. It is used by millions of developers around the world to create web applications.
If you are interested in learning more about JavaScript, there are many resources available online and in libraries. You can also find many JavaScript tutorials and courses that can teach you the basics of the language.

            <h2>JAVA</h2>
            Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform that allows application developers to write portable code that can run on any Java-enabled platform.
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. Java bytecode is generated by the Java compiler.
Java is a high-level language, meaning that it is closer to human language than to machine language. This makes Java easier to learn and code in than assembly language or machine code. Java is also a statically typed language, meaning that the data types of variables must be declared before they are used. This helps to prevent errors and makes Java code more readable.
Java is a platform-independent language, meaning that Java code can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This makes Java a popular choice for developing cross-platform applications.
Java is a secure language, meaning that Java code is less likely to contain security vulnerabilities than code written in other languages. This is because Java has a number of security features built into the language, such as bytecode verification and sandboxing.
Java is a robust language, meaning that Java code is less likely to crash than code written in other languages. This is because Java has a number of features that help to prevent errors, such as garbage collection and exception handling.

            <h2>SQL</h2>
            SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a programming language that allows users to store, retrieve, update, and maintain information in a relational database. Relational databases store data in tables, with rows and columns representing data attributes and relationships. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as storing, retrieving, updating, and searching data in a database. SQL can also be used to optimize database performance.
            SQL is used by database administrators, developers, and data analysts. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) adopted an official SQL standard in 1986, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted it in 1987. New versions of the SQL standard are published every few years. 
            SQL statements generally ignore insignificant whitespace, making it easier to format SQL code for readability. 
            SQL is used when data needs to be stored and accessed, such as when using a website, mobile app, or application. 
            SQL injection is a cyberattack that involves tricking a database with SQL queries. For example, a hacker might enter a SQL query in place of a person's name in a submission form to retrieve, alter, or corrupt data in a SQL database.
